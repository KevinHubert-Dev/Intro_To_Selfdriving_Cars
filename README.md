# Intro_To_Selfdriving_Cars
My project i've develop during the Udacity Nanodegree program: Learn the essentials of building a self-driving car, including probability, C++, machine learning, and linear algebra.

# Projects
During the nanodegree there were multiple projects to plan, develop and publish for review. All projects were reviewed by Udacity mentors. When i've received ideas or tips to improve my code, i've added it to the specific project afterward.

## Joy ride
The task of this project was implementing a simple time or location based algorithm in python, which let's a virutal car (simulated in Unity3D) park parallel.

For this project i've used both the time-based value and available x/y coordinates. The project gave a first preview of the so called jupyter notebook and working enviroment.

The juypter notebook and source code can be found in the folder called "Project_1 - Joy Ride"
